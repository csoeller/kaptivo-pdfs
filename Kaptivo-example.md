## Using Recap (Panopto) with the Kaptivo digital whiteboard source

I noticed that in many of my lecture recordings the whiteboard is either poorly legible or not visible at all. This can be greatly improved by use of the Kaptivo Live Whiteboard Sharing technology that I was recently able to trial.

A small recap recording that demonstrates the use of Kaptivo and its utility in recording presentations, clips and lectures with proper rendering of the whiteboard.

This was produced on a macbook pro that ultimately struggled a little with live input from 3 sources, i.e. live camera, screen 1 and screen 2. However, with suitable hardware this should not be an issue. One screen has the software that is being demonstrated but could equally be a popwerpoint, the other runs the live Kaptivo view of the whiteboard (this view also has some flaws as it is set up on the screen and in the browser - it could be easily improved).

### A first test of the technology

[This video](https://recapexeter.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9bb93f9d-da0b-46ce-b647-abc000da39f3) shows a quickly edited recap session, that could be further improved by more careful editing of focus switching.

In addition to the live view of the whiteboard a [*time line* PDF](https://github.com/csoeller/kaptivo-pdfs/blob/master/Kaptivo-RZRTSN_2020-05-19_14-12.pdf) of the whiteboard is also generated automatically and can be inspected in conjunction with the screen recording.
